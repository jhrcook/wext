# WExT Examples #

### Description ###
Here we provide simple examples of running WExT on simulated data for demonstration purposes.

### Usage ###
Each example has its own directory and Makefile.

### Examples ###
We have one example for running WExT in [`simple`](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/tree/add_test_statistics/examples/simple). We recommend using this example to test if WExT is working on your machine.
We have another example for running WExT on Pan-Cancer data in [`pancan`](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/tree/add_test_statistics/examples/pancan).
For more examples, see [our files for reproducing the experiments in the ECCB/Bioinformatics paper](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/tree/master/experiments/eccb2016).
