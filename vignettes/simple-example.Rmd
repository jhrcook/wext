```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"

The data used for this example is the same data set in the "simple" example from the Raphael group's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/tree/master/examples/simple). The original file format was one line per sample with a list of the genes that were mutated. I have already prepared this into a tidy format in "data-raw/simple_dataset.R".

```{r}
simple_dataset
```
