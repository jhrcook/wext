# wext (development version)

# wext 0.0.0.9001

* Created vignette explaining the statistics of WExT - the next version will have a vignette explaining the computational methods use to solve it.
* The package now builds because I add a small example data set from the Raphael GitHub repo to future testing. There is also a single function for turning a named matrix into a tibble.

# wext 0.0.0.9000

* Initialized the package in RStudio using 'devtools', 'usethis', 'pakrat', and 'pkgdown'. Continuous integration will be used via AppVeyor and Travis-CI.
