The somatic mutations in the pathways that drive cancer development tend to be mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing driver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This mutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable mutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for exclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational frequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision.

WExT is a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of mutual exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. It conditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event, per-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute *P*-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and efficient saddle-point approximation of the test.

[The Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT)](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext) was developed by the [Raphael research group](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University and originally implemented as a command line tool running in Python. This is an adaptation for R with specific intention to be compatible with the ['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org).

## Installation

**This package is still in development and not ready for use.**

You can install the released version of wext from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r cran_install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("wext")
```

or from GitHub using 'devtools':

```{r github_install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jhrcook/wext")
```
