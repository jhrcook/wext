#' A recursive solver for the Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT)
#'
#' @description This is a recursive solver for the equation \deqn{\Phi_{WR}(M) =
#'   \text{Pr}(T_M \ge t_M | Y_M = \vec{r}_M)} This equation calculates the
#'   liklihood of finding \eqn{t_M} mutually exclusive events in the gene set
#'   \eqn{M} of length \eqn{k} given fixed margins.
