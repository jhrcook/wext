This vignette explains how the null distribution for the Row-Column-Exclusivity test is generated.

A great explanation of the process can be found in the Methods section of "Mutual exclusivity analysis identifies oncogenic network modules" by Ciriello *et al.* (2012).

It is based off of the algorithm created by Milo *et al.* in "On the uniform generation of random graphs with prescribed degree sequences" (2003).

In R, the edge swaps can be conducted using `igraph::rewire(gr, keeping_degseq(loops = FALSE, niter = N))` where `N <- 100 * igraph::ecount(gr)`.
